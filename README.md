# MBTA_API
Python Script to consume the MBTA REST API


Prompts user for Commuter Line Name, Starting Stop, Ending Stop, and Departure Time

Creates an GET request to the offical MBTA API and displays the first three trains that can be taken.

FUTURE PLAN FOR IMPROVEMENT: allow user to enter stops on different line to create a trip that can span multiple different commuter rail lines
